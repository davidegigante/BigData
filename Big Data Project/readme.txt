Python Package Installation Guide
==================================

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install all the necessary Python packages required to run scripts, including those for plotting and web interface.

Steps to Follow:
----------------

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt** on your computer.

2. **Ensure that Python is installed on your system.** You can check this by running:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```
   If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Install the required packages.** Use the following command to install Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Flask:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn flask
   ```
   This command utilizes `pip`, the Python package installer.

4. **Verify the installation.** After the installation is complete, you can verify it by trying to import these packages in a Python shell or script.

5. **Run your Python scripts.** With these packages installed, you should be able to run the scripts for data analysis, plotting, and the web interface.

If you encounter any issues during installation, ensure that your Python and pip are up to date. Updating Python and pip might resolve installation problems.
